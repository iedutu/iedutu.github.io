## Overview

This will explain how to setup your ASUS router’s SSH access through the most secure solution currently available: using SSH keys stored on hardware keys. For this I am using the [Yubikey 5](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/) NFC family of keys - I have 2 USB-A and 1 USB-C.

The code snippets are from a generic macOS terminal screen.


## My work environment

Router used - [ASUS RT-AX86U](https://www.asus.com/Networking-IoT-Servers/WiFi-Routers/ASUS-Gaming-Routers/RT-AX86U/)
Router firmware - [Asuswrt-Merlin](https://www.asuswrt-merlin.net) 386.7_2
Installed software (**not** needed for this) - [Entware](https://hqt.ro/how-to-install-new-generation-entware/), [Debian](https://hqt.ro/how-to-install-debian-stretch-arm/). AMTM v3.3
Dropbear v2022.82
Yubikey 5 NFC, Firmware 5.4.3

My workstation - Apple M1 Pro, macOS 12.6. Brew info:
{% highlight console %}
==> **openssh**: stable 9.0p1 (bottled)
==> **bash**: stable 5.1.16 (bottled), HEAD
{% endhighlight %}

## Generating the SSH keys

We are going to generate a **ed25519-sk** key pair. The system automatically splits the private key and keeps one half locally (~/.ssh/ed25519_sk) and the other half on the hardware key.
{% highlight console %}
> ssh-keygen -o -a 256 -t ed25519-sk
Generating public/private ed25519-sk key pair.
You may need to touch your authenticator to authorize key generation.
Enter PIN for authenticator:
You may need to touch your authenticator (again) to authorize key generation.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/cristian/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/cristian/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk
Your public key has been saved in /Users/cristian/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:8iyT8nCbeCR0uxsoWAQ9B21n6iiNK1IUso8JORFXtEQ cristian@macbook
The key's randomart image is:
+[ED25519-SK 256]-+
|ooo*E            |
|oo+.+.o          |
| =.=.+           |
|=.. o .          |
|.O.+ ...S        |
|=o= o.o=         |
|.+. +o*.o        |
|+  . *o*         |
|o   ..=.         |
+----[SHA256]-----+

{% endhighlight %}

Remember to chmod 400 the keys in your ~/.ssh folder.
{% highlight console %}
>chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk*
{% endhighlight %}

## Uploading the public key to the router

We are going to upload the public key to the router now.



1. Copy your public key
{% highlight console %}
>cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk.pub
sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com AAAAGnNrLXNzaC1lZDI1NTE5QG9wZW5zc2—---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BHNzaDo= cristian@macbook
{% endhighlight %}

2. Open your router admin page and go to Administration → System → Service.Ensure the router is properly configured for SSH access and simply paste your key in. Please note you can have multiple keys, each one on a separate line.

3. Apply


## Connecting to the router

To connect, simply use the command below. Touch the key when requested.
{% highlight console %}
>ssh cristian@----------.com -o AddKeysToAgent=no -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk
Enter passphrase for key '/Users/cristian/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk':
Confirm user presence for key ED25519-SK SHA256:8iyT8nC----------------------------8JORFXtEQ
User presence confirmed

cristian@router:/tmp/home/root#
{% endhighlight %}

**WARNING** - macOS by default has a ssh-agent which automatically adds authenticated keys into its volatile cache. At the time of writing this, the ssh-agent is not able to use the key saved in its cache on a second authentication attempt, hence 

the {% highlight console %}-o AddKeysToAgent=no{% endhighlight %} option.


## Still to do …


1. Test the connectivity on Linux and Windows.
2. Check if Apple/Google have SSH clients on their AppStores which support hardware key based SSH keys and test.
3. Find a solution for the macOS ssh-agent, if possible.
